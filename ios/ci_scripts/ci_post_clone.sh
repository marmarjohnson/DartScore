# Prepares an Xcode Cloud runner for this Flutter app.
#
# Xcode Cloud clones the repository and then builds the Xcode project directly.
# It knows nothing about Flutter, so without this script the build fails on the
# first line of ios/Flutter/Generated.xcconfig, which is not in the repository
# because it is generated per machine and holds absolute paths.
#
# Xcode Cloud runs this after cloning and before resolving dependencies, from
# inside ci_scripts/, with CI_PRIMARY_REPOSITORY_PATH pointing at the checkout.
#
# There is no Podfile in this project, so nothing installs CocoaPods here. Add
# a pod install step if that ever changes.

# Keep this in step with the SDK the app is developed against. Xcode Cloud has
# no Flutter of its own, so an unpinned clone would silently move the build to
# whatever stable happens to be current that day.

# used, so a cloud build and a local one produce the same number.
